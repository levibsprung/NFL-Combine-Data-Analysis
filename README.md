# NFL Combine Results Data Analysis
### Final project for CSCI303 - Intro to Data Science

I did a project to try to predict NFL success based on performance in the NFL combine for my data science class in Fall 2023. As I expected, the results were inconclusive, as a lot more goes into predicting NFL success than testing well at the combine, although more advanced stats may be more predictive.

The data was from [this dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present), containing NFL combine and play statistics from 2004 to 2020. The presentation poster is also in this repo.
